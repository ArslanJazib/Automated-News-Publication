                                        and partnership between Chicago Tribune film critic Gene Siskel and Chicago
                                        Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert are coming to life in a new book called
                                        'Opposable Thumbs.' According to the [Chicago Tribune](
                                        https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-ent-siskel-ebert-opposable-thumbs-1015-20231011-bn4wwuxfqzem7alzjqdhwkfzwm-story.html),
                                        this rivalry captivated the city they both resided in and has been a topic of
                                        debate for years. The book takes a deep dive into their passionate and sometimes
                                        contentious partnership, which began in 1976 with WTTW-TV's "Opening Soon at a
                                        Theater Near You." As film critics, Siskel and Ebert were at the top of their
                                        field in Chicago, and their rivalry brought an engaging intensity to the world

                                        other news, following Russia's invasion, Ukraine has been fighting against an
                                        enemy with a massive military and a dominating economy. It is only due to nearly
                                        $350 billion in aid, offered by mostly Western countries since January of 2022,

                                        particularly from the United States, Ukraine's most important military backer.
                                        As Ukraine continues to battle against overwhelming odds, the discussions
                                        surrounding adherence to military aid commitments, the focus on rebuilding

                                        cultural history and the international landscape's complexities. The legacy of
                                        Chicago's film critics serves as a reminder of the drive and vision that can
                                        propel a city to greatness, while the tense situation in Ukraine showcases the
