A starter theme called chicagostarai.

== Description ==

\"ChicagoStarai\" is a custom WordPress theme meticulously designed to offer a perfect blend of style and functionality. Built on an Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) block-based structure, it provides you with the flexibility to craft unique and dynamic content.  The theme features jQuery data tables for interactive and organized page listings, Bootstrap 5 for a modern and responsive design, and utilizes the WP-SCSS compile plugin for efficient and clean styling with SCSS. This combination ensures a visually appealing and user-friendly experience for your website visitors.

This thoughtful design approach simplifies the setup process and ensures a smooth transition when managing your website.
